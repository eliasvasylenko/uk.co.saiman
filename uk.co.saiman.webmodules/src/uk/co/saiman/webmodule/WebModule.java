   * TODO generalize this as a scoped & versioned resource registry, not just for
   * ES6 modules? Should we be able to serve other kinds of resources and consume
   * them e.g. through ajax?
   * 
   * 
   * 
   * 
   * Where do we need versioned resources (es6 modules definitely, multiple can
   * exist side-by-side, they are never accessed directly by a user), and when do
   * they not make sense. A landing page or index shouldn't be versioned, there
   * should only be the latest one configured, same with most user-facing web
   * pages.
   * 
   * 
   * 
   * 
   * Other resources? Images, css, etc? Will different user-facing pages use
   * different versions of them? Possibly, this is certianly the case with es6
   * modules, which do need to consume css at the very least.
   * 
   * 
   * 
   * 
   * Makes sense for only the user-facing end-points to be unversioned, as much
   * else as possible should be versioned.
   * 
   * Two ways to approach the divide between versioned resources & unversioned
   * end-points:
   * 
   * - anything that is included as a build-time dependency on another OSGi bundle
   * should be accessed in a properly versioned way at runtime, thus avoiding
   * dependency collisions.
   * 
   * - avoid dependency collisions by wiring together dependencies by
   * configuration. Give the app-deployer the responsibility of management.
   * 
   * Some combination of the two approaches is necessary?
