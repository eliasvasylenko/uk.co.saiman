/**
 * An experiment instruction is the machine-consumable unit of information to
 * describe how an experiment step should be executed.
 * <p>
 * An experiment instruction corresponds to a node in an experiment graph, and
 * should typically be processed as part of a {@link Procedure procedure}.
 * <p>
 * For information about the experiment graph, @see
 * uk.co.saiman.experiment.procedure
 * <p>
 * Generally instructions should not be generated by hand, as the API provides
 * little protection against invalid configurations and is cumbersome for direct
 * use. Rather, they are intended as a target for higher-level APIs to emit in
 * order to prepare and direct experiment execution.
