/**
 * An experiment procedure is the machine-consumable bundle of information to
 * describe how a experiment should be conducted.
 * <p>
 * An experiment procedure describes a complete experiment graph, where each
 * node is described by its constituent {@link #instructions() instructions}.
 * <p>
 * Generally procedures should not be generated by hand, as the API provides
 * little protection against invalid configurations and is cumbersome for direct
 * use. Rather, they are intended as a target for higher-level APIs to emit in
 * order to prepare and direct experiment execution.
