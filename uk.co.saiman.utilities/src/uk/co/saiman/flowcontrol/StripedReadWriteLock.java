/**
 * A striped lock may contain any number of locks, which are indexed by a keys
 * of a given type.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The purpose of a striped lock is generally to avoid deadlock in systems with
 * many different locks. This is achieved by requiring {@link Thread}s to
 * acquire all the locks they will need in one go, then releasing them when
 * possible, meaning that a thread will never be waiting for a lock when it
 * already has one.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class does not enforce that a {@link Thread} does not try to obtain more
 * locks when it already has some, this is expected to be dealt with in user
 * code, though it would be trivial to implement a subclass providing this
 * functionality. Instead the {@link StripedReadWriteLockRelease} interface is
 * provided such that once locks are acquired, processes can be given the means
 * to release and query the state of those locks without leaking the ability to
 * acquire more.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The overloads of {@link #obtainLocks(Collection, Collection)} will block
 * until every requested lock is obtained, without allowing deadlocks to occur
 * between multiple blocking threads.
