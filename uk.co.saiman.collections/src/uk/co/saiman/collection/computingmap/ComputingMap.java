 * associated with a particular computation - which effectively is equivalent to
 * a function from type {@code K} to type {@code V}. This means that we may
 * simply add a key to the map and have the associated value be calculated and
 * added automatically.
 *
 * This interface may form the basis of a caching system, for example.
