/**
 * An implementation of the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 specification at
 * https://semver.org/ for interoperability with OSGi systems.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Semver versions can be consistently converted to OSGi versions while
 * retaining exact ordering semantics. Major, minor, and micro components are
 * mapped exactly, and an OSGi qualifier string is generated based on the
 * pre-release component of the semver.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Any semver which is supported can be round-tripped to OSGi and back again
 * while preserving ordering.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Translation quirks:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>OSGi versions do not support negative qualifiers, so naive translation
 * from semver would order pre-releases higher than releases, therefore the
 * qualifier is prepended with REL or PRE for release or pre-release versions
 * respectively</li>
 * 
 * <li>OSGi qualifiers are always compared as strings, so in order for the
 * ordering of numeric components of semver pre-release versions to be respected
 * they must be padded with leading zeroes.</li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Limitations:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>Build information is stripped on conversion to OSGi. Build information
 * has no bearing on ordering so this is not a significant issue.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Any numeric components are limited to 32 bit unsigned integers, including
 * major, minor, micro, and pre-release identifiers.</li>
 * 
 * </ul>
