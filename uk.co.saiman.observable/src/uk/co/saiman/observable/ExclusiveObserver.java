/**
 * This is a helper class for implementing {@link Observable passive
 * observables}.
 * <p>
 * A passive observable is one which does not maintain a set of observations or
 * manage its own events, instead deferring to one or more upstream observables.
 * When an observer subscribes to a passive observable, typically the observer
 * is decorated, and the decorator is then subscribed to the parents. This way
 * the decorator can modify, inspect, or filter events as appropriate before
 * passing them back through to the original observer.
 * <p>
 * This class is a partial implementation of such a decorator.
