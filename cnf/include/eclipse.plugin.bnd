#### Define BSN ####

# We want to match the default behaviour for generating the BSN - the project name then the sub-bundle name.
# We do this so we can add singleton:=true on the end for silly equinox.
Bundle-SymbolicName: ${p}${bsn.sub.bundle};singleton:=true

# Some internals expect this location specifically, for some reason
Bundle-Localization: plugin

Bundle-ActivationPolicy: lazy

# bnd.bnd files seem to error on ${thisfile}, which is no good
-fixupmessages.thisfile:\
	\\\\$\\{thisfile\\} executed on a processor without a properties file,\
	No translation found for macro: thisfile

# determine if we are in bnd.bnd
filename.bnd.bnd: ${is;${thisfile};\\${thisfile}}

# sub bundles need to append their filename w/o the extension
bsn.sub.bundle: ${if;${filename.bnd.bnd};;.${filename.noext;${thisfile}}}
